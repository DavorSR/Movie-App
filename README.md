Simple movies data app where API provided by [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) is used to fetch: images, descriptions, name etc for every movie, movies are show by random order.

Used JS, CSS and HTML5.

- Used innerHTML and appendChild to enable automatically change in html code by data fetch from API.


Further plans:

 - Integration of slider and functional search field.
 - New page for every movie with more data and video trailers.
